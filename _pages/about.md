I am a PhD student at Stanford University, advised by Professor [Judith Fan](https://profiles.stanford.edu/judith-fan).

My research is at the intersection of cognitive science and artificial intelligence (AI). Through my work, I hope to better understand the computational principles behind human intelligence, and use these insights to (1) build more advanced AI systems and architectures, (2) improve human-AI collaboration, and (3) accelerate progress in AI alignment.

Before coming to Stanford, I've worked across a few different fields, including cognitive science, machine learning, and economics, and I aim to combine ideas from these fields in my current research. For my undergrad, I graduated from a Dual BA at Columbia University and Institut d'Ã©tudes politiques de Paris, where I majored in Economics and Social Sciences, respectively. After that, I spent two years working with [Paul Romer](https://paulromer.net/) at NYU, whom I owe a great deal for helping me discover the beauty of coding. I then moved to the UK for a Master's in Statistical Science at the University of Oxford, where I had the pleasure to work with [Jakob Foerster](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/) and [Christian Schroeder de Witt](https://schroederdewitt.com/), and afterwards spent a wonderful year as pre-doc research fellow at Harvard University, working with [Sam Gershman](https://gershmanlab.com/people/sam.html) and [Fiery Cushman](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/fiery-cushman).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
